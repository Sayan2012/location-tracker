# 🕵️‍♂️ Location Tracker — The Sneaky Geolocator

This Python script *covertly* tricks users into handing over their geolocation — all under the guise of a simple web prompt.

- **Requests browser location permission**
- **Silently logs latitude & longitude**
- **Deceives users with dynamic templates to keep them hooked**

## ⚡ Features

- **Geolocation Hijack:** Browser popup asks for location access — will they comply?  
- **Silent Data Capture:** Sends user coordinates right to your Flask backend for logging.  
- **Template Trickery:** Choose from multiple fake templates (festival, travel, gift, birthday) to keep the ruse believable.
